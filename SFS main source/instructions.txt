I made 4 names for poke addresses:
	scr_ctrl (scroll control):  32848
	scr_os (offset):  32849 (2 bytes)
	scr_page1 (page of screen 1):  32851
	scr_page2:  32852

First open your two screens for quick buffering, poke page numbers to routine:
	SCREEN 1: POKE (32851),IN 252 BAND 31
	SCREEN 2: POKE (32852),IN 252 BAND 31

Load in the screens:
	FOR c=0 to 2
	LOAD screen c (left hand side of map) into screen 1 (presumably display 2 while this is happening)
	POKE (32848),c: CALL 32768
	NEXT c
	
To display:
	POKE (32849),nn: REM Scroll offset in 4-pixels.  This will be between 512 (extreme left) and 128 (extreme right).  With the Ken level I tested it was 2.5 screens wide, you can go down to 0 but you'll get black screen.
	POKE (32848),-1  for screen 1, or -2 for screen 2
	CALL 32768
